      <h3>CONTENT CAPTURE</h3>
    
      <p>Point the device's camera at the content. Press the “Capture” button. A 
      countdown starting at 5 seconds will begin. Line the webcam view up with the 
      content. Once 5 seconds has elapsed, the content rendition will be displayed in the web browser.</p>
       
      <h3>RENDITION ADJUSTMENT</h3>
       
      <p>Should the default binary rendition not suit the situation, use the rendition buttons to select another type of rendition. Click the “Colour” button to see the original colour content. Click the “Monochrome”  button to see the content in grayscale. Click the “Inverted” button to see the content as a monochrome negative. Click the “Binary” button to again see the content white and the background black.</p>
       
      <h3>QUALITY ADJUSTMENT</h3>
       
      <p>Should the default binary rendition lack fidelity, use the Content Distance text field to adjust the quality upon next capture. Enter a number less than 34 if the rendition lacks text. Enter a number greater than 34 if the rendition has too much white in the background. Once set, click the “Capture” button to refresh the rendition.</p>
      
      <h3>BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT</h3>
       
      <p>Touch and drag up in the right-half of the rendition to increase brightness; touch and drag down to decrease brightness.</p>
       
      <h3>CONTRAST ADJUSTMENT</h3>
       
      <p>Touch and drag right in the top-half of the canvas to increase contrast; touch and drag left to decrease contrast.</p>
       
      <h3>COLOUR ADJUSTMENT</h3>
       
      <p>Should the default colour of the background and text in the binary rendition not be suitable, use the “Background Colour Value” and “Text Colour Value” text input fields to change them. Input desired R, G and B values in the text fields labelled R, G and B and press “Capture” to apply changes.</p>
